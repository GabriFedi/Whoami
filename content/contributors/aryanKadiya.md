## About me
Hello All,

I'm Aryan Kadiya.

My name is Aryan Kadiya and pursing my Bachelorâ€™s Degree from Charotar University of Science and Technology and currently studying in Third year. I like knowing about human psychology and philosophy.


Here is one poem by Joyce Alcantara which I find very inspiring:


*You may see me struggle,</br>
but you won't see me fall.</br>
Regardless if I'm weak or not,</br>
I'm going to stand tall.</br>
Everyone says life is easy,</br>
but truly living it is not.</br>
Times get hard,</br>
people struggle</br>
and constantly get put on the spot.</br>
I'm going to wear the biggest smile,</br>
even though I want to cry.</br>
I'm going to fight to live,</br>
even though I'm destined to die.</br>
And even though it's hard</br>
and I may struggle through it all,</br>
you may see me struggle...</br>
but you will NEVER see me fall.*</br>







Have a nice day friend.
