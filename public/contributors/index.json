I like knowing about human psychology and philosophy.\nHere is one poem by Joyce Alcantara which I find very inspiring:\nYou may see me struggle,\nbut you won\u0026rsquo;t see me fall.\nRegardless if I\u0026rsquo;m weak or not,\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to stand tall.\nEveryone says life is easy,\nbut truly living it is not.\nTimes get hard,\npeople struggle\nand constantly get put on the spot.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to wear the biggest smile,\neven though I want to cry.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to fight to live,\neven though I\u0026rsquo;m destined to die.\nAnd even though it\u0026rsquo;s hard\nand I may struggle through it all,\nyou may see me struggle\u0026hellip;\nbut you will NEVER see me fall.\nHave a nice day friend.\nYou can find me at\n YouTube LinkedIn Github Gmail  Thank You\n"
